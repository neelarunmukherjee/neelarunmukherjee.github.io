### Research Focus
I investigate groundwater flow and reactive solute transport in Arctic permafrost landscapes, with particular emphasis on the supra-permafrost aquifer zone.  My work aims to understand how thawing permafrost and changing climate conditions influence carbon cycling, groundwater discharge, and greenhouse gas emissions.I integrate field observations, laboratory experiments, remote sensing data, and numerical modeling using high-performance computing.  My approach focuses on developing mechanistic frameworks to quantify the movement of heat, nutrients, and carbon through complex subsurface environments.

### About my origin
I am originally from [Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata), the capital city of West Bengal in India, often called the [City of Joy](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/india/articles/why-kolkata-is-the-city-of-joy-in-25-instagram-photos/).  
I have been fascinated by subsurface processes since my undergraduate days and am deeply interested in how groundwater shapes ecosystems, carbon cycles, and climate dynamics.  
Outside of research, I enjoy traveling, hiking, running, playing violin and photography.
