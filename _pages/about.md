### Research Focus
I investigate groundwater flow and reactive solute transport in Arctic permafrost landscapes, with particular emphasis on the supra-permafrost aquifer zone.  
My work aims to understand how thawing permafrost and changing climate conditions influence carbon cycling, groundwater discharge, and greenhouse gas emissions.
I integrate field observations, laboratory experiments, remote sensing data, and numerical modeling using high-performance computing.  
My approach focuses on developing mechanistic frameworks to quantify the movement of heat, nutrients, and carbon through complex subsurface environments.

### About Me
I am originally from [Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata), the capital city of West Bengal in India, often called the [City of Joy](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/india/articles/why-kolkata-is-the-city-of-joy-in-25-instagram-photos/).  
I have been fascinated by subsurface processes since my undergraduate days and am deeply interested in how groundwater shapes ecosystems, carbon cycles, and climate dynamics.  
Outside of research, I enjoy exploring landscapes shaped by water and engaging with outreach programs to inspire the next generation of scientists.
