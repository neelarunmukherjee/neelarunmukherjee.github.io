### Research Focus
I investigate groundwater flow and reactive solute transport in Arctic permafrost landscapes, with particular emphasis on the supra-permafrost aquifer zone. My work aims to understand how thawing permafrost and changing climate conditions influence carbon cycling, groundwater discharge, and greenhouse gas emissions.

I integrate field observations, laboratory experiments, remote sensing data, and numerical modeling using high-performance computing. My approach focuses on developing mechanistic frameworks to quantify the movement of heat, nutrients, and carbon through complex subsurface environments.

### About My Origin
I am originally from [Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata), the capital city of West Bengal in India, often called the City of Joy. Kolkata is known for its history, intellectual rigor and cultural richness. I developed an early interest in mathematics and physics from my school days at [Nava Nalanda](https://navanalanda.org.in/). This attracted me towards the elegant complexity of fluid mechanics in my early college days. That curiosity found its direction in college, where I became fascinated by the elegant chaos of fluid mechanics. Whether in rivers, reservoirs, pipes, or airfoils—if it flowed, I wanted to understand it.  

Naturally, this fascination found wheels when I joined [TeamKART](https://teamkart.org/), the Formula SAE student team at IIT Kharagpur. As part of the vehicle dynamics group, I worked on CFD simulations and design optimizations on aero, chassis, & suspension systems. There’s something thrilling about seeing your code turn into carbon fiber and speed—those years were unforgettable and still make for great stories during coffee breaks.  

Over time, my interest in flow shifted gears—from engineered machines to natural landscapes. I became intrigued by how fluids move through porous media like soil, rock, and permafrost, and how such movement shapes ecosystems and climate feedbacks. This growing obsession led me toward hydrology, particularly computational hydrology, where physics, Earth science, and high-performance computing converge.  

My academic journey has since taken me from the warmth of Kolkata and Kharagpur to the heat of Texas and the chill of the Arctic, where I now study subsurface flow, thawing permafrost, and reactive transport using fieldwork and numerical models. Outside of research, I enjoy traveling to places colder than my dataset, hiking in unfamiliar terrains, playing the violin, and photographing natural landscapes—often looking for fluid patterns even when none are required.
