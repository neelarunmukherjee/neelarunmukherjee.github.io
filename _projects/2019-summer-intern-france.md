- Designed and performed a 3D experiment for laser scanning of Rayleigh Taylor instability of miscible fluids in a porous media 
- Studied the variation of onset time and mixing length in pore scale for density-driven instability 
- Analyzed anisotropy with the change in mixing length using inverse formulation
