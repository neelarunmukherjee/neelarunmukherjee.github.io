title: "Numerical study of Rayleigh Taylor Instabilities in porous media with geoelectrics"
collection: projects
type: "Undergraduate Summer Internship"
permalink: /projects/2020-summer-intern-france
venue: "UMR METIS, Sorbonne Universite"
location: "Paris, France"

- Developed a flow and transport code for Rayleigh Taylor Instability in porous media
- Coupled effective conductivity calculation with flow and transport by current injection through it as the instability evolves 
- Analyzed anisotropy with the change in mixing length using inverse formulation
